## **Introduction**

The company aims to analyze the impact of physical, geographic, and other factors on property prices in Melbourne using sales data from 2015-2016. This will be achieved through a data-driven statistical analysis, completed within a 10-day work period, to enhance marketing strategies and portfolio management at the beginning of November 2024.

## **Data Overview**

This dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot), includes 13,580 house data from all region in Melbourne, offering a solid basis for analysis.

## **Problem Breakdown**

The analysis will address the following questions:

1. Does the number of bedrooms and bathrooms significantly affect property prices?
2. Does the availability of parking spaces impact property prices?
3. What is the effect of land size on property prices in different regions?
4. What is the effect of building size on property prices in different regions?
5. Does a newer property generally have a higher price?
6. How is the distribution of property prices across different regions?
7. Does the closer proximity of a property to the Central Business District result in higher prices?
8. Is there a significant price difference between property types?
9. What are the trends in property prices over time?
10. Is there a correlation between property prices and the number of properties in a given area?

## **Methodology**

The analysis consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning header column, handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding key patterns.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating correlations and performing hypothesis testing.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using Tableau for creating interactive visualizations to represent key findings.

## **Conclusion**

- **Physical Factors**: The number of bedrooms and bathrooms positively impacts property prices; larger properties tend to have higher prices. Land size and building size also have a strong influence. Additionally, older properties are often cheaper due to their strategic locations.

- **Geographical Factors**: Property prices are heavily influenced by location. Metropolitan regions are more expensive than Victoria, and properties closer to the Central Business District (CBD) are priced higher due to higher demand.

- **Other Factors**: Price differences across property types show significant variation. Property prices fluctuate over time, influenced by external factors like economic conditions and market preferences.
